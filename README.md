# Gaussian-Processes
Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces Project to play with the theory
# gpis.py:
Still need to add y(x) = -1 and y(x) = +1 for a proper training, 
as well as calculate the surface normals and use them for the training process

# gpis4.py:
Fixed the above. TODO: Check isosurface.m from matlab and try to translate the code in Python
